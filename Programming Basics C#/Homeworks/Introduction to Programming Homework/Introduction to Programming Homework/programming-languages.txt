Problem 11. Programming Languages

1. Java - used for building server-side applications to video games, mobile apps (Android). 
Java and C# are quite similar, because both of them:
- are type-safe languages,
- have build and garbage collection;
- are "pure" object-oriented languages;
- have single inheritance;
- all objects are references;
- are built in Uni-Code support, etc.
The differences between them: Java will run on any operating system as opposed to C#.

2. Python - could be used for pretty much anything , from web apps to data naalysis.
C# paradigms are structured, imperative, procedural, object-oriented, event-driven, functional, generic, reflective and concurent.
Phyton follows pbject-oriented, imperative, functional, procedural and reflective paradigms.

3. Ruby - major supplier of web apps. 
Ruby and C# are both OO languages, but Ruby is a dynamic language. C# is on it's way to becoming a dynamic language too. 
Ruby's use of symbols is pretty big difference over the languages.

4. PHP - an open-suorce language, used in conjunction with dynamic data-heavy websites and app development. 
C# is an object-oriented programming language , while PHP is a server side scripting language. Both of them are used in web developement.

5. C - best for small and low-level applications
C# inherits most of its operators, keywords, and statements directly from C languages, but C# is the first component-oriented language in C family.
Another difference is destructors, their syntax is the same with C languages but actually they are very differenet.
